## In the beginning

There were bands with songs, and there were visual artists with... yes, art. Those two camps had didn't always have the easiest time getting together... though I think they realy wanted to. For eons the two
would produce beautiful work and long to share it with the other party... but limited searches, restrictive and exclusive and costly, sites dictated who saw who... it wasn't a pretty site.

## Then there was

Dokay.com saw the need and filled it.
With the help of a few daft thumbs and opinonated faces, Dokay did what others dared not to do... didn't think was possible (Wayne). And now the arts can play freely, in a random world, they have found a home.

## How it works

A user will set up a simple profile, this account will be good for individuals wanting to listen and see, or for artists wanting to use the app. After a user sets up an account and logs in, the home page will randomly select music and present images, the user can like or dislike images based on the music they hear.

For aritsts wishing to run a campaign, they can link tracks (up to 5) from their [soundcloud](https://www.soundcloud.com) account, and then upload up to 10 images to go with each track.

artists can see their results, and they can archive or delete campaigns once they've achieved their goals.

## Why it works

This app works for both, users just wanting to interact with their favorite artists, as well as listen to new music, and artists wishing to engage their fans and recieve realtime feedback on topics like branding, image, marketing, and perception.
