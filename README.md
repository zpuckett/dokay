### In the beginning...

There were bands with songs, and there were visual artists with... yes, art. Those two camps had didn't always have the easiest time getting together... though I think they realy wanted to. For eons the two
would produce beautiful work and long to share it with the other party... but limited searches, restrictive and exclusive and costly, sites dictated who saw who... it wasn't a pretty site.

<br>

### Then there was...

Dokay.com saw the need and filled it.
With the help of a few daft thumbs and opinonated faces, Dokay did what others dared not to do... didn't think was possible (Wayne). And now the arts can play freely, in a random world, they have found a home.

### How it works

It's the simpliest of concepts, even your little brother could do it. All users make a basic user profile, then they get to swiping. For those that want to submit, they can do it in their profile. A simple song submit form for the musically inclined, and a jpeg upload form for those with images (please, don't submit art that isn't yours or that you don't have absolute rights to share, we'll ban you and then talk crap about you to others... really). Swipping is simple enough; to the left if you don't like it, to the right if you do, and then down if you find the image innapropriate (this will help us crack down on people trying to advertise their only fans page).

Once you log in, you'll be given a random song, then you get to match the song with the image you think best represents it. You'll hear the song until you swipe right and match it, then you'll be given a new song and the dance starts all over again.

<br>

### Why it works

Why would anyone even want to use this app? Hush yo mouth! Want to be introduced to new music? Music that isn't being played on heavy rotation (but maybe should be?) and by artists that could use some real support? How about looking at beautiful images and finding inspiration thru the eyes of visual artists? Any of that sound appealing? If it doesn't... I'm sure you should go back to looking at your flow charts and stock graphs. For the rest of us that are perhaps, wanting a dose of something new and different, Dokay is definitely something you should download and utilize, either as an artist wanting to share their works or as a user wanting to get some fresh feels (or heck, be both).
